# weatherllama
This is an experimental project exploring langchain and ollama.

The project uses Ollama to run a model of choice locally. It then uses the Langchain Ollama API to send a CSV file over to the LLM and asks the LLM to answer questions off the CSV data.
The CSV data is downloaded from Kaggle.
